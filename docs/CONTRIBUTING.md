## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Go 1.21+** installed ([Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/))
- **Git** for version control
- A **GitHub account** for pull requests

Quick Go installation (optional):

```bash
# Using go-installer (easy way)
curl -sSfL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faelmori/go-installer/refs/heads/main/go.sh' | bash
```

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone**

   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitHub first
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gocrafter.git
   cd gocrafter
   
   # Add upstream remote
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/rafa-mori/gocrafter.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Download Go modules
   go mod download
   
   # Install development tools
   go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
   go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
   ```

3. **Build and Test**

   ```bash
   # Build the project
   go build -o gocrafter .
   
   # Run tests
   go test ./...
   
   # Test the CLI
   ./gocrafter list
   ```

4. **Verify Everything Works**

   ```bash
   # Create a test project
   ./gocrafter new test-project --template api-rest
   cd test-project
   go mod tidy
   go build
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a Feature Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Write Code**
   - Follow Go best practices and conventions
   - Add appropriate comments and documentation
   - Write tests for new functionality

3. **Test Your Changes**

   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   go test ./...
   
   # Run linting
   golangci-lint run
   
   # Format code
   goimports -w .
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "type: brief description of changes"
   ```

   Use conventional commit types:
   - `feat:` - New features
   - `fix:` - Bug fixes
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `style:` - Code style changes
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `test:` - Adding tests
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

5. **Push and Create PR**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## Code Standards

### Go Style Guide

We follow the standard Go style guide:

- Use `gofmt` and `goimports` for formatting
- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions small and focused

### Template Development

When creating or modifying templates:

1. Follow the [Template Development Guide](template-development.md)
2. Include proper `template.json` metadata
3. Use template variables consistently
4. Test generation with various configurations
5. Document template features and usage

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new functions
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Integration Tests

- Test CLI commands end-to-end
- Verify template generation works correctly
- Test with different configurations

```bash
# Run integration tests
go test -tags=integration ./tests/...
```
